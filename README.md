# One Prompt Applications

This is a collection of simple, fully working applications created for at least 95% from a single prompt. The remaining 5% tolerance reflects the fact that one or more versions required minor adjustments to fix small issues in the graphics or calculations.

Each application in this repository is a small, self-contained project designed to demonstrate how far a single well-written prompt can go in producing usable software. The examples cover practical logic, interface behaviour, and core features, making the collection useful both as a showcase and as a learning resource for AI-driven development and publishing.

## Tetris

The Tetris example is an MVP implementation of the classic block-stacking game, built to demonstrate core gameplay mechanics, playability, and prompt-driven development in a compact format. It is intended as a practical example of how a single prompt can produce a working game with only limited post-generation refinements.

This application is available in two versions: one generated by **Claude Sonnet 4.6** (the stronger version from a graphics and design point of view) and one generated by **GPT-5.3-codex** (equally valid in gameplay terms, but with a slightly rougher presentation).

**Prompt**: "*Build a complete Tetris game with standard rules: a 10x20 playfield, seven tetromino types, line clearing mechanics, and increasing difficulty. Include controls for moving, rotating, soft/hard dropping pieces, and holding a piece. Implement scoring based on lines cleared and levels that increase fall speed. Ensure the game ends when the stack reaches the top. Provide a clean UI with on-screen stats (score, level) and options to pause/restart. Keep the code clean and modular and ship a playable, balanced MVP.*"

## Tower Defense

The Tower Defense example is a playable browser-game MVP in which the player places and upgrades defensive towers to stop waves of enemies moving along a fixed path. It demonstrates a strong one-prompt outcome for game logic, user interaction, balancing basics, and clear visual feedback, while remaining small enough to study as a practical learning example.

This application is presented in two versions: one generated by **Claude Sonnet 4.6** and one generated by **GPT-5.3-codex**. The two implementations take slightly different approaches (for example, single-file versus more modular structure), which makes them useful for comparing how different models solve the same product brief.
