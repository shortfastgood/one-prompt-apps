# Prompts Applications

This is a collection of simple, fully working applications created for at least 95% from a single prompt. The remaining 5% tolerance reflects the fact that one or more versions required minor adjustments to fix small issues in the graphics or calculations.

Each application in this repository is a small, self-contained project designed to demonstrate how far a single well-written prompt can go in producing usable software. The examples cover practical logic, interface behaviour, and core features, making the collection useful both as a showcase and as a learning resource for AI-driven development and publishing.

## Tower Defense

The Tower Defense example is a playable browser-game MVP in which the player places and upgrades defensive towers to stop waves of enemies moving along a fixed path. It demonstrates a strong one-prompt outcome for game logic, user interaction, balancing basics, and clear visual feedback, while remaining small enough to study as a practical learning example.

This application is presented in two versions: one generated by **Claude Sonnet 4.6** and one generated by **GPT-5.3-codex**. The two implementations take slightly different approaches (for example, single-file versus more modular structure), which makes them useful for comparing how different models solve the same product brief.
