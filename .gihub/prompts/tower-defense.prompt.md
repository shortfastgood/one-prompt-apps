Build a complete tower defense game with a fixed path where enemies spawn in waves, you earn money per kill, and you lose lives when enemies reach the end. Include at least 3 tower types (different range/damage/attack speed) with upgrades, plus a simple UI to place/sell/upgrade towers and start the next wave; keep the code clean and modular and ship a playable, balanced MVP. Include basic polish: pause/restart + on-screen stats (wave, lives, money).
