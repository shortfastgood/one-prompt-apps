Build a complete Tetris game with standard rules: a 10x20 playfield, seven tetromino types, line clearing mechanics, and increasing difficulty. Include controls for moving, rotating, soft/hard dropping pieces, and holding a piece. Implement scoring based on lines cleared and levels that increase fall speed. Ensure the game ends when the stack reaches the top. Provide a clean UI with on-screen stats (score, level) and options to pause/restart. Keep the code clean and modular and ship a playable, balanced MVP
